rtree
=========

In-memory immutable 2D [R-tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) implementation in java using [RxJava Observables](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) for reactive processing of search results. 

Status: *pre-alpha*

This was fun to make, has an elegant concise algorithm, is thread-safe and fast.

The algorithm to achieve immutability is cute. For insertion/deletion it involves recursion down to the 
required leaf node then recursion back up (using a stack built as we recurse down) to replace the parent nodes up to the root. The guts of 
it is in [Leaf.java](src/main/java/com/github/davidmoten/rtree/Leaf.java).

[Backpressure](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Backpressure) support required further complexity because effectively a
bookmark needed to be kept for a position in the tree and returned to later to continue traversal. An immutable stack containing
 the node and child number of the antecedents came to the rescue here.

Features
------------
* immutable R-tree suitable for concurrency
* type-safe
* pluggable splitting heuristic ([```Splitter```](src/main/java/com/github/davidmoten/rtree/Splitter.java)). Default is [Guttman's quadratic split](http://www-db.deis.unibo.it/courses/SI-LS/papers/Gut84.pdf).
* pluggable insert heuristic ([```Selector```](src/main/java/com/github/davidmoten/rtree/Selector.java)). Default is least minimum bounding rectangle area increase.
* search returns [```Observable```](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observable.html) 
* search is cancelled by unsubscription
* over 80K inserts per second on i7 single thread
* search is ```O(log(N))``` on average
* insert, delete are ```O(N)``` worst case
* all search methods return lazy-evaluated streams offering a lot of flexibility and opportunity for functional composition and concurrency
* balanced delete
* supports [backpressure](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Backpressure)

Number of points = 100, max children per node 4:

Getting started
----------------
Add this maven dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.davidmoten</groupId>
  <artifactId>rtree</artifactId>
  <version>0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

How to build
----------------
```
git clone https://github.com/davidmoten/rtree.git
cd rtree
mvn clean install
```
Example
--------------
```java
import com.github.davidmoten.rtree.RTree;
import static com.github.davidmoten.rtree.geometry.Geometries.*;

RTree<String> tree = RTree.maxChildren(5).create();
tree = tree.add("DAVE", point(10, 20))
           .add("FRED", point(12, 25))
           .add("MARY", point(97, 125));
 
Observable<Entry<String>> entries = tree.search(Rectangle.create(8, 15, 30, 35));
```

What do I do with the Observable thing?
----------------------------------------
Very useful, see [RxJava](http://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava).

As an example, suppose you want filter the search results then apply a function on each in parallel and reduce to some best answer:

```java
import rx.Observable;
import rx.functions.*;
import rx.schedulers.Schedulers;

Func1<Entry<String>, Character> firstCharacter = entry -> entry.object().charAt(0);
Func2<Character,Character,Character> firstAlphabetically = (x,y) -> x <=y ? x : y;

Character result = 
    tree.search(Rectangle.create(8, 15, 30, 35))
        // filter for names alphabetically less than M
        .filter(entry -> entry.value() < "M")
        // use a different scheduler for each entry
        .flatMap(entry -> Observable.just(entry).subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
        // get the first character of the name
        .map(entry -> firstCharacter(entry.value()))
        // reduce to the first character alphabetically 
        .reduce((x,y) -> firstAlphabetically(x,y))
        // subscribe to the stream and block for the result
        .toBlocking().single();
System.out.println(list);
```
output:
```
D
```
